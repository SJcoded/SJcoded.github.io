Hi, welcome to the files section of my website.

My main purpose for this site was to test out my HTML,CSS & Javascript skills
to see if I can create a few animations and simple javascript capabilities.

Please feel free to branch this project and create your own site to practice 
manipulating files by filling in your own content.

If you're interested in hiring a developer or designer, contact me through email
or give me a call and I should get back to you soon. 

Other than that, enjoy the code!
